- In order to properly determine whether City Bikes would be economically viable in Des Moines, further analyses are needed. We need to compare the population and demographics of Des Moines in relation to NYC. Furthermore, we need to see how weather and geographic differences between the two cities play a factor in bicycle usage. Therefore, we cannot make a conclusive statement as to whether City Bikes would be profitable in Des Moines, Iowa.
